# Web Infrastructure Design

This project involves the design and implementation of a single-server web infrastructure to host the website www.foobar.com. The infrastructure utilizes a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and aims to provide a basic yet functional setup for web hosting.

## Project Components:

### Server:

- **Server (Single Server Setup):**
  - Hosts Apache as the web server, PHP for server-side scripting, and MySQL as the database management system.
  - Application files (code base) reside within the server.

### Setup Details:

- **Linux OS:** Utilizes Ubuntu Server for the operating system.
- **Apache (Web Server):** Serves HTTP requests and hosts website content.
- **MySQL (Database):** Stores and manages website data.
- **PHP (Server-Side Scripting):** Executes application logic and generates dynamic content.

## Specifics and Purpose:

- **LAMP Stack:** Provides a basic web hosting environment with essential components.
- **Server Roles:** Apache for web serving, PHP for server-side scripting, MySQL for data storage.
- **Application Files:** Contains the code base responsible for the website's functionality.

## How to Deploy:

- **Server Provisioning:** Set up an Ubuntu Server instance.
- **Software Installation:** Install and configure Apache, MySQL, and PHP on the server.
- **Code Deployment:** Upload the application files to the appropriate directory.
- **Testing:** Access the server's IP or domain to ensure proper functioning of the website.

## Considerations:

- **Scalability:** Limited to a single server setup, may face challenges with scaling for increased traffic.
- **Security Measures:** Implement firewall rules and regular updates for enhanced security.
- **Maintenance:** Plan regular backups and maintenance schedules for optimal performance.
